Must Create 3 options of rock paper and scissors without case sensitivity
let a = "rock"
let b = "paper"
let c = "scissors"
allow for the program to get a string from the user
getcomputerchoice will need to select one of the 3 choices
the computer must compare the user entered choice with the choice the computer gave

function playRound(playerSelection, computerselection) {
    if (playerSelection === computerSelection)
        console.log("It's a draw! %s is equal to %s"(playerSelection, computerSelection));
        else if (playerSelection = "rock" && computerSelection === b)
        console.log("You lose! Paper beats rock!");
        else if (playerSelection = "rock" && computerSelection === c)
        console.log("You win! Rock beats Scissors!");
        else if (playerSelection = "paper" && computerSelection === c)
        console.log("You lose! Scissors beats paper!");
        else if (playerSelection = "paper" && computerSelection === a)
        console.log("You win! Paper beats rock!");
        else if (playerSelection = "scissors" && computerSelection === a)
        console.log("You lose! Rock beats scissors!");
        else if (playerSelection = "scissors" && computerSelection === b)
        console.log("You win! Scissors beats paper!");
    }
Attempt to push prompts into an array and have the loop make the program access a different function.
Separate what is being printed when the outcome comes so that the computer can read that and change the score separately from the function
